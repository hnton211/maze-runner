# maze-runner

This is a project written in NetLogo programming language to demonstrate some AI searching strategies.
The searching methods implemented in this project includes:
1. Breadth-first search
2. Depth-first search
3. Greedy-best first search.
4. A* search.
You will need NetLogo application to run this file.

Instructions: 
- "Maze" button: choose which maze for the agent to work through, there are 5 mazes.
- "Level" button: there are 3 levels:
    + Level 1: One agent, one-way.
    + Level 2: One agent, two-way.
    + Level 3: Multiple agents, one-way.
- "Strategy-forward" button: Choose among the implement methods for the agent to solve the maze moving
from start to finish.
- "Strategy-backward" button: Choose among the implemented methods for the agent to solve the maze moving
backward from finish to start. (only for level 2)

Note:
- The explored path will be shown in pink.
